# MIPS Integer Multiply Project

This is a small beginner project for my Computer Architecture class.  
The goal is to multiply two positive integers (0 to 32767) using only shifts and adds in MIPS.

## What the program does

- Asks the user to enter two positive integers
- Checks if the numbers are in the allowed range
- Uses a loop with shifts and adds to calculate the product
- Prints the result with a friendly message

## Files in this repo

- multiply.asm : MIPS code for the integer multiply
- screenshot.png : Screenshot showing the program running
- observations.docx : My notes about how much time I spent and what I learned

## Tools used

- MARS 

## What I learned

I practiced using loops, conditions, and bit shifts in MIPS.  
I also learned how to handle input validation and make the program more user-friendly.
